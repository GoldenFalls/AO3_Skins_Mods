/* This bookmarklet removes excess spacing in between paragraphs on AO3.
Check out Flamebyrd's https://random.fangirling.net/scripts/how_to_use_bookmarklets for instructions on how to make and use bookmarklets.

A more HTML-oriented/detailed description of what this bookmarklet does:
Background info: non-breaking spaces prevent your browser from collapsing whitespace and empty lines
* Finds all <p> paragraph elements that contain a non-breaking space and replaces them with normal spaces. Your browser now should automatically collapse any empty lines or other excess whitespace
* Finds all the <br> line break elements in the chapter and deletes those, since sometimes works will end up with the text of paragraphs being preceded by line breaks, or paragraphs just consisting of line breaks*/
