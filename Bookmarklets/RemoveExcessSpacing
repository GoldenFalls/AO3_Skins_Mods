/* This bookmarklet removes excess spacing in between paragraphs on AO3.
Check out Flamebyrd's https://random.fangirling.net/scripts/how_to_use_bookmarklets for instructions on how to make and use bookmarklets.

A more HTML-oriented/detailed description of what this bookmarklet does:
* Finds all <p> paragraph elements in a chapter where the only content is a non-breaking space
(as opposed to a normal space, thus preventing the browser from just not displaying it or letting you target it through CSS methods),
and then removes all the contents of that paragraph element. So now the browser ignores/collapses it!
* Finds all the <br> line break elements in the chapter and deletes those, since sometimes works will end up with the text of paragraphs being preceded by line breaks*/
