/* This skin reduces the width of the header dropdown menus to the width of their content.
Mainly useful for mobile, since it means the user dropdown is no longer partway off the screen.
However, the reduced size for the main navigation menus can be annoying, so if you want to limit it to only the user navigation dropdowns, add '.user' after '#header'

Some older browsers don't support 'min-content' or only support it as 'min-intrinsic'.
You can check support coverage here: https://caniuse.com/#search=min-content
If you don't know what browser version you're using, it should be available somewhere in your browser's about or settings, or you can find a website which will tell you.
